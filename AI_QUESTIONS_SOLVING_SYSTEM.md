# AI Questions Solving System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a seamless question-solving system for AI-generated questions that allows users to solve questions by topic without navigation disruptions. The system includes optimistic UI updates, solution viewing, and history tracking.

## Key Features

### 1. **Seamless Question Solving Interface**
- Questions are displayed one at a time in a focused view
- User can submit answers and immediately see the solution
- Question doesn't vanish after submission - remains visible with solution
- Navigation between questions with Previous/Next buttons
- Progress tracking showing attempted vs total questions

### 2. **Optimistic UI Updates**
- Immediate feedback when submitting answers
- Questions stay in view after submission with solution shown
- Local state management prevents questions from disappearing
- Graceful error handling with rollback on failure

### 3. **Question History View**
- View last 10 attempted questions for the topic
- Shows attempt status (Correct/Incorrect)
- Displays mistake categories if provided
- Easy navigation between solving mode and history mode

### 4. **Smart Question Loading**
- Backend filters out already attempted questions
- Questions are ordered by difficulty (easiest first within user's grade range)
- Limited to 50 questions per session for optimal performance
- Real-time cache invalidation after attempts

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### New Controller Methods (`aiQuestion.controller.ts`)

1. **`getQuestionsForSession`**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/ai-questions/topic/:topicSlug/session`
   - Returns all unattempted questions for a topic
   - Filters by user grade and difficulty range
   - Excludes already attempted questions
   - Includes full question details (solution, hints, strategy, etc.)
   - Ordered by difficulty (ascending) then creation date

2. **`getRecentAttemptsByTopic`**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/ai-questions/topic/:topicSlug/attempts`
   - Returns user's recent attempts for a specific topic
   - Includes full question details and attempt data
   - Removes duplicate attempts (keeps latest per question)
   - Limited to specified number (default 10)

#### Routes Added (`aiQuestion.routes.ts`)
```typescript
// Get questions for solving session
router.get("/topic/:topicSlug/session", aiQuestionController.getQuestionsForSession);

// Get user's recent attempts for a topic
router.get("/topic/:topicSlug/attempts", aiQuestionController.getRecentAttemptsByTopic);

// Get user stats (already existed, kept for reference)
router.get("/stats", aiQuestionController.getUserAIQuestionStats);
```

### Frontend Changes

#### New Components

1. **`AiTopicQuestionSession.tsx`**
   - Main solving interface component
   - Handles question navigation and attempt submission
   - Implements optimistic UI updates
   - Progress tracking and navigation controls
   - Features:
     - Current question display with QuestionUI
     - Navigation buttons (Previous/Next)
     - Skip to next unattempted question
     - Progress bar showing completion
     - History button to view past attempts
     - Solution shown immediately after submission

2. **`AiQuestionHistory.tsx`**
   - Displays recent attempts for a topic
   - Shows question cards with attempt status
   - Includes metadata (difficulty, time taken, mistake category)
   - Back button to return to solving mode

3. **Updated Page (`[topicSlug]/page.tsx`)**
   - Simplified to act as a view switcher
   - Two modes: "solve" and "history"
   - Floating action buttons for navigation
   - Clean UI with back button to topics list

#### Service Methods (`aiQuestion.service.ts`)

```typescript
// Get questions for solving session
async getQuestionsByTopicForSession(topicSlug: string)

// Get recent attempts
async getRecentAttemptsByTopic(topicSlug: string, limit: number = 10)

// Get user stats
async getUserStats(): Promise<UserAIStats>
```

## User Flow

### Solving Questions
1. User navigates to a topic from the subject page
2. System loads all unattempted questions for that topic
3. User sees first unattempted question
4. User can:
   - Submit answer → Solution shown immediately
   - Use hint (if needed)
   - Navigate to previous/next question
   - Skip to next unattempted question
   - View history of attempted questions
5. After submission:
   - Question remains visible
   - Solution accordion opens automatically
   - User can review strategy, common mistakes, and solution
   - Progress bar updates
   - User can navigate to next question when ready

### Viewing History
1. Click "View History" button
2. See last 10 attempted questions
3. Each card shows:
   - Question preview
   - Attempt status (Correct/Incorrect)
   - Difficulty level
   - Time taken
   - Mistake category (if applicable)
4. Click "Back to Questions" to continue solving

## State Management

### Local State
- `currentQuestionIndex`: Tracks current question position
- `attemptedQuestions`: Set of attempted question IDs
- `localAttempts`: Map storing attempt data per question
- `isSubmitting`: Prevents duplicate submissions
- `showSolution`: Controls solution visibility per question

### React Query
- Cache key: `["ai-questions-session", topicSlug]`
- Stale time: 5 minutes
- GC time: 10 minutes
- Automatic cache invalidation on successful attempt

## Key Improvements

### 1. No Question Vanishing
- Previously: Questions would disappear immediately after submission
- Now: Questions stay visible with solution displayed
- User can review the full question and solution together

### 2. Optimistic Updates
- Immediate UI feedback on submission
- Question marked as attempted locally
- Solution shown without waiting for server response
- Graceful rollback if server request fails

### 3. Better Navigation
- Clear progress indication
- Easy navigation between questions
- Option to skip to next unattempted question
- History view for reviewing past attempts

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Focused, distraction-free solving interface
- Immediate access to solutions after answering
- No page reloads or navigation jumps
- Smooth transitions between questions

## Data Flow

```
User Submits Answer
    ↓
Optimistic Update (Local State)
    ↓
Show Solution Immediately
    ↓
API Call to Backend (/attempts)
    ↓
Backend Stores Attempt
    ↓
Response Returns
    ↓
Update Local State with Real Data
    ↓
Invalidate Cache (triggers refetch if needed)
```

## Error Handling

1. **Network Errors**: Rollback optimistic updates, show error toast
2. **API Errors**: Remove optimistic attempt, restore question state
3. **Loading States**: Show loading spinner while fetching questions
4. **Empty States**: Display appropriate messages when no questions available

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoization**: Heavy calculations memoized with useMemo
2. **Cache Strategy**: React Query with 5-minute stale time
3. **Limited Data**: Only 50 questions per session to reduce payload
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI response without waiting for server
5. **Lazy Loading**: History loaded only when requested

## Mobile Responsiveness

- Responsive navigation controls
- Adaptive button sizes
- Mobile-friendly floating action buttons
- Progress bar scales appropriately
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Timer per Question**: Track time spent on each question
2. **Bookmarking**: Allow users to bookmark difficult questions
3. **Filter Options**: Filter history by status (correct/incorrect)
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Show topic-wise performance metrics
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest topics based on weak areas
6. **Spaced Repetition**: Resurface questions for review
7. **Offline Support**: Cache questions for offline solving
